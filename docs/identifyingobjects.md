# Identifying Objects in Legacy Code

This approach uses reverse engineering activities to abstract an object-oriented model from legacy code. The section presents a method for decomposing legacy code into objects. The identification of objects is focused around how legacy code interacts with persistent data stores, such as files or tables in the database.  The rationale behind this choice is that the object-oriented decomposition of a legacy system will make the modernized system easier to design, implement,test and maintain.
